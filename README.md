Welcome to Franco, Arkar, and Shahriar's 2024 Hack(Her)413 Project! We built a NodeJS and React real-time chat application. Our app supports group, 1-on-1 chats, real-time messaging, and image and file support. Note: Due to the chatengine.io API being locked behind a paywall, the application may or may not function once the free trial ends.




Instructions on running/hosting local: 

Open terminal: 1) enter the frontend directory "cd frontend", 2) run "npm install vite --save-dev" 3) run "npm run dev"

Open another terminal: 1) enter the backend directory "cd backend" 2) "npm run start" 3) follow the localhost link.

Enjoy chatting!
